## Diving deeper features:
- Arrow next to list items (both warehouse and inventory) animate to give visual cues to user
- Warehouses and inventories can be searched by their properties to filter matches (this happens as the user types)
- Warehouse and inventory properties can be sorted by ascending, descending or none (toggling between the 3)
